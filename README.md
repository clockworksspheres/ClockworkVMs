## OBE - (2021-11-06 overcome by events) I've not been able to keep this repo up to date with the boxcutter repositories, and compiled with current versions of Qt/PyQt.

# ClockworkVMs
PyQt wrapper for public cloud templates and packer by HashiCorp - https://www.packer.io

VmBuilder provides the ability to download and minimally re-configure cloud templates for building virtual machines.  The first repositories that will be available via this method are the https://github.com/boxcutter repositories:

<br>https://github.com/boxcutter/ubuntu
<br>https://github.com/boxcutter/debian
<br>https://github.com/boxcutter/bsd
<br>https://github.com/boxcutter/centos
<br>https://github.com/boxcutter/oraclelinux
<br>https://github.com/boxcutter/macos
<br>https://github.com/boxcutter/fedora

The application should work on all systems that have a functional install of Python 2.7 and PyQt 5.  The macos repository will only work on a system that is running macOS.

## This is early release software, in development.

External dependancies:

pyOpenSSL - Project relies on pyOpenSSL for creating macos VM's
